This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications when using third-party libraries that don't handle asynchronous operations correctly, specifically in relation to accessing component state or props. The `BugAsyncLib.js` file showcases the problematic code, where a library attempts to access the component's state before it's fully mounted. The `BugAsyncLibSolution.js` file provides a solution by incorporating appropriate lifecycle methods and asynchronous handling to ensure safe access to component state and props.
